Dear Abuse Team,

We detected a phishing website hosted at:

${baseInfo}

This fake website was created to attack ${companyDescription}. The organization's legitimate website is: ${data.detected_brand?.official_url || '[Official URL]'}.

${evidenceBlock}

Besides that, we have found issues where the page is activated and deactivated by the fraudster according to their configuration, so even though it may seem inaccessible, the phishing page can be reactivated at any time.

That is why we request your action to help us deactivate the content available not only on the reported URL, but also in the whole server related to the domain.

We kindly ask your cooperation, according to your policies, to cease this activity and shut down the phishing page as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance. We would also appreciate it if you could provide a confirmation that this message has been received and an estimate of the time to shutdown.

Best regards,
Anti-Phishing Team`;
